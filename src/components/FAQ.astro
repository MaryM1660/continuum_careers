    question: 'How does voice-first career coaching work?',
    answer: 'You have a natural conversation with our AI — just like talking to a senior career advisor. The AI asks targeted questions to uncover your achievements, leadership moments, and technical decisions. Everything is automatically transcribed, structured, and turned into career assets. No typing, no forms.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What markets does Continuum support?',
    answer: 'We currently support career transitions targeting the US, UK, and EU markets. Our AI understands the nuances of each market — from visa considerations to salary benchmarks and cultural expectations in interviews.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are parallel career tracks?',
    answer: 'Instead of committing to one career direction, Continuum lets you explore multiple paths simultaneously. For example, you can maintain an IC Lead track, an Engineering Manager track, and a Product Manager track — each with its own positioning narrative, tailored resume, and preparation materials.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from a resume builder?',
    answer: 'Resume builders optimize keywords. Continuum rebuilds your entire career positioning from the ground up. Continuum uncovers real achievement cases through voice interviews, build strategic narratives, assess gaps, prepare you for interviews, and manage your pipeline. It\'s a complete career co-pilot, not a document formatter.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Anti-Plan?',
    answer: 'The Anti-Plan is a unique Continuum feature. It maps out the career path you explicitly want to avoid — the roles, companies, and situations that would make you miserable. This helps the AI steer all recommendations away from those patterns, even when they might look attractive on paper.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data private and secure?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Your voice recordings are processed and then deleted — we only keep the structured insights. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We never share your information with employers or recruiters without your explicit consent.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Continuum on mobile?',
    answer: 'Yes! Continuum is designed to be voice-first and mobile-native. Have coaching sessions during your commute, review your pipeline on the go, and get preparation tips before interviews — all from your phone.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to pay to get started?',
    answer: 'No. The Explorer plan is completely free — you get 3 voice discovery sessions, 1 career track, and a basic gap assessment. Upgrade to Professional when you\'re ready for unlimited sessions and parallel career tracks.',
  },
