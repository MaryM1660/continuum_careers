    question: 'How is this different from a resume builder?',
    answer: 'Resume builders start with a template and ask you to fill in keywords. We start with understanding you — through real conversations. From that understanding, we generate targeted resumes, cover letters, interview prep, and career strategy. Different role? Different resume, different cover letter, different talking points — all from the same deep profile.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a Career DNA profile?',
    answer: 'Your complete professional identity — not a resume, not a LinkedIn summary. Career DNA captures everything you bring to the table: skills you take for granted, achievements you\'ve forgotten, directions you haven\'t considered. Structured and ready to be positioned differently for each career path.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What do you mean by "multiple career tracks"?',
    answer: 'Your experience tells many different stories. The same achievement can be a leadership story for one role, a strategic thinking story for another, and a crisis management story for a third. We help you see all viable directions and know what to highlight for each one.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where does the methodology come from?',
    answer: '<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5"><li>Built on real career consulting practices — from hands-on work with recruiters and career coaches</li><li>What used to take months with a premium consultant, now AI-powered and just as personalized</li><li>Available when you need it — no 30-minute weekly slots</li></ul>',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after I land the job?',
    answer: 'That\'s where most tools stop. We don\'t. Continuum helps you navigate your probation period, prepare for 1:1 meetings, communicate achievements to leadership, build your case for promotion, and maintain an always-current Career DNA. When your next move comes — whether in a year or five — your profile is already up to date and your tracks are ready.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the voice-first approach work?',
    answer: 'Natural conversations with AI that works like a senior career advisor — it listens, asks the right follow-up questions, and guides the conversation to draw out what really matters. No forms, no bullet points, no character limits. Everything is structured automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What markets does Continuum support?',
    answer: 'We currently support career transitions targeting the US, UK, and EU markets. Our AI understands the nuances of each market — from visa considerations to salary benchmarks, interview culture, and the difference between how companies hire in Berlin vs. San Francisco vs. London.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to pay to get started?',
    answer: 'No. The Explorer plan is completely free — you get voice discovery sessions, one career track, and a basic Career DNA profile. Upgrade when you\'re ready for extended voice sessions, parallel career tracks, and the full co-pilot experience.',
