    question: 'How is this different from a resume builder?',
    answer: 'Resume builders give you templates and ask you to fill in bullet points. Continuum is fundamentally different. We build your complete Career DNA profile through voice conversations — understanding every case, pivot, and hidden strength. Then we generate targeted documents, career paths, and strategy from that profile. You don\'t fill forms. You talk. We understand.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a Career DNA profile?',
    answer: 'It\'s your complete professional identity — not a resume, not a LinkedIn summary. Career DNA captures the full complexity of your experience: the fact that your title was "Lead Developer" for 5 years but you actually changed 5 different roles under the hood. Every case, every skill, every strength and blind spot — tagged, structured, and ready to be positioned differently for each career track.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What do you mean by "multiple career tracks"?',
    answer: 'Your experience can tell many different stories. The same case about leading a team pivot might be a leadership story for an Engineering Manager track, a strategic thinking story for a Product Lead track, or a crisis management story for a CTO track. We help you see all viable paths, understand what to highlight or hide for each one, and run them in parallel.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where does the methodology come from?',
    answer: 'Our practices are built on 10+ years of hands-on career consulting — real knowledge from top recruiters and career coaches, not generic "10 tips to improve your LinkedIn." We\'ve distilled what used to be a 6-month engagement with a premium career consultant into an AI-powered format that\'s just as personalized — and you get unlimited time, not 30 minutes once a week.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after I land the job?',
    answer: 'That\'s where most tools stop. We don\'t. Continuum helps you navigate your probation period, prepare for 1:1 meetings, communicate achievements to leadership, build your case for promotion, and maintain an always-current Career DNA. When your next move comes — whether in a year or five — your profile is already up to date and your tracks are ready.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the voice-first approach work?',
    answer: 'You have natural conversations with our AI — like talking to a senior career advisor who truly listens. No forms, no bullet points, no character limits. Talk for as long as you need. The AI asks the right questions to draw out your real cases: "You said you rebuilt the team — what specifically did you do that quarter?" Everything is transcribed, structured, and tagged automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What markets does Continuum support?',
    answer: 'We currently support career transitions targeting the US, UK, and EU markets. Our AI understands the nuances of each market — from visa considerations to salary benchmarks, interview culture, and the difference between how companies hire in Berlin vs. San Francisco vs. London.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to pay to get started?',
    answer: 'No. The Explorer plan is completely free — you get voice discovery sessions, one career track, and a basic Career DNA profile. Upgrade when you\'re ready for unlimited voice sessions, parallel career tracks, and the full co-pilot experience.',
